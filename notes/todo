- Make the output continuous. It'll be easier on the bot. Can also decrease NN size to 2x4x1 or 2x4x4x1 or something.

- Print the decision chart at the end of training (by grid sampling)
- Bunch time steps together. No need to decide more than 8 (no. of strats) times per episode.
- Restrict fragment length to 4 hours or so
- Run over entire fragment, starting at 1 minute intervals
- Think hard about rl algo. 8x8->8 needs no approximation
- If using rl-keras after all, get tensorboard on board

Future:
- Combine aoerl and PGP to jointly test them to determine optimal trading period lengths.
- Investigate benefits of having two limit orders simultaneously.
- Once we combine market state variables into aoerl, we can train it to estimate cost in advance, and put that in the consumption tensor of PGP.

done:
Since we're dealing with smaller volumes, we need to decide wether action space is really made of price points or strategies (highest bid, midway, etc.).
