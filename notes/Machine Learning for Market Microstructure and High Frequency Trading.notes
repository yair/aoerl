This is a chapter (of a book?), reviewing some past work.
They cover --
- Optimized Trade Execution via Reinforcement Learning, for which we have notes
- Predicting Price Movement from Order Book State - unpublished work, since it is barely worth it past trading costs (but might be worth it in combination of other things, like optimizing further the bullet point above).
- The dark pool stuff, for which we don't care.
